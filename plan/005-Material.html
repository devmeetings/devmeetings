            #2/ Think of the best way to show required features of language / framework:
            Usually on the slides we show other (very similar, yet simplified) app being developed.
            It should have the same problems, but different domain.
            -----------------------------------------------
            #2/ Example
            - Task: Shop app: Display list of products (feature: loop)
            - Slides: Todo app: display list of tasks (feature: loop)
            -----------------------------------------------
            #4/ App on slides should be focused only on language / framework features
            - Try to keep slides minimal - don't write the code just because you can.
            - Comment the code - describe why you do something, the intention behind the code.
            - Use single file (if possible) - don't jump between files, it's confusing.
            - Keep the code inside visible area - scrolling when presenting is bad.
            - Remember that most probably you will present on low-resolution beamer.

            Defining a tasks is obviously not enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            You also need to explain features of language / framework to participants before they start doing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tasks should be also related to presented material - participants should immediately see how to apply stuff you presented to solve the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            First give them tools and inspire to solve the problems.
