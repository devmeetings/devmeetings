          <p>A core part of Devmeeting is <strong>writing an app</strong></p>
          <p>
            On every Devmeeting participants should write full-featured (yet limited) app from scratch, completely on their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            After choosing a topic you should start thinking on what app participants will write.
