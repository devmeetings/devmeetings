#2/ Start with the technology and also
# add participants expected background.
AngularJS for Java Developers

#2/ You would expect it will be much different from:
AngularJS for Frontend Developers
AngularJS for Backbone Developers

#3/ On those workshop you might expect that the focus will be on
#2/ rapid prototyping and not on complex architecture and design patterns:
AngularJS for Web Developers
AngularJS for Web Designers

#3/ Some other examples that worked for us:
# Detailed scope, version implies that prior AngularJS knowledge is expected
AngularJS 1.5 + ES6 + TypeScript

#7/ Some examples that didn't work:
# Too generic
ModernJS
# Doesn't say what kind of usage it's focused on (REST APIs?) and for who (Backend devs? JS devs? Nodejs devs?)
Nodejs + Express

# Would attrack JS developers that want to learn ES6, but also newbies that would like to start with JS
ES6 essentials
