            #5/ Example Sprints for Modern JavaScript for Backend Developers (App: Online Shop)
            1. Display hardcoded list of products in HTML & CSS [no JS yet].
            2. Generate a list of products in JS given an array of products.
            3. Implement flexbox layout for products
            4. Implement products filtering &amp; search.
            5. Implement a persistent cart.

            #10/ Example basic tasks for those sprints:
            1. - Display single product in HTML and style it.
               - Display many products.
            2. - Generate single product in JS using DOM APIs.
               - Generate products given an array of product-models.
            3. - Display products in a grid
               - Style the header of the shop
            4. - Split your code into Model &amp; View using ES6 classes
               - Implement search box, place logic inside Model class.
            5. - Fetch products from JSON file
               - Use LocalStorage to persist a cart

          <h2>Couple of rules to have in mind when preparing Sprints:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Allow people to make mistakes
              <ul>
                <li>Don't teach them everything right from the start,</li>
                <li>Let them make something in a wrong way, to propose better solution in next Sprint.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            Start small
              <ul>
                <li>First think about minimal app the is tangible (renders something)
                    and define minimal set of language / framework features to achieve that,</li>
                <li>Keep code at minimum - it's better to learn basic stuff correctly, don't re-write documentation.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Define critical path
              <ul>
                <li>What's minimal increment to be done in a step to be able to attempt next Sprint.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

        <header><h1>Split Backlog into Sprints</h1></header>
        <details>
          <p>
            So you already know that participants will write an app and have filled their Backlog.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that the app should be developed Agile (Scrum-like) way.
          </p>
          <p>
            App Backlog should be split into Sprints, each Sprint should result in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and should also introduce and present some new features of language / framework (topic).
