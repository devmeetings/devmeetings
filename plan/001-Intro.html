            #2/ Start with the technology and also
            # add participants expected background.
            AngularJS for Java Developers

            #2/ You would expect it will be much different from:
            AngularJS for Frontend Developers
            AngularJS for Backbone Developers
            
            #3/ On those workshop you might expect that the focus will be on
            #2/ rapid prototyping and not on complex architecture and design patterns:
            AngularJS for Web Developers
            AngularJS for Web Designers

            #3/ Some other examples that worked for us:
            # Detailed scope, version implies that prior AngularJS knowledge is expected
            AngularJS 1.5 + ES6 + TypeScript

            #7/ Some examples that didn't work:
            # Too generic
            ModernJS
            # Doesn't say what kind of usage it's focused on (REST APIs?) and for who (Backend devs? JS devs? Nodejs devs?)
            Nodejs + Express

            # Would attrack JS developers that want to learn ES6, but also newbies that would like to start with JS
            ES6 essentials

          <p>When you're preparing a Devmeeting it's good to start with a right topic.</p>
          <p>
            It cannot be to general, because it will attrack people with very diverse backgrounds and it's hard to make one size that would fit them all.
