          <h2>Couple of rules to have in mind when preparing iterations:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Allow people to make mistakes
              <ul>
                <li>Don't teach them everything right from the start,</li>
                <li>Let them make something in a wrong way, to propose better solution in next iteration.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            Start small
              <ul>
                <li>First think about minimal app the is tangible (renders something)
                    and define minimal set of language / framework features to achieve that,</li>
                <li>Keep code at minimum - it's better to learn basic stuff correctly, don't re-write documentation.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Define critical path
              <ul>
                <li>What's minimal increment to be done in a step to be able to attempt next iteration.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

        <header><h1>Split app into iterations</h1></header>
        <details>
          <p>
            So you already know that participants will write an app.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that the app should be developed Agile (Scrum-like) way.
          </p>
          <p>
            App development should be split into iterations, each iteration should result in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and should also show some new features of language / framework.
          </p>
