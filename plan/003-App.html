          <p>A core part of Devmeeting is <strong>writing an app</strong></p>
          <p>
            On every Devmeeting participants should write full-featured (yet limited) app from scratch, completely on their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            After choosing a topic you should start thinking on what app participants will write. Fill their Backlog - make a list of things they will wirte.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why app? It should be something tangible, something to show to their friends (or best: gradma) after the workshop. With many "visual assertions" indicating that the task is actually done - it should be very easy to test if task has been done correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually it might be better for you to write the App on your own first, and only after that think about the Backlog.
