# Prepare various tasks levels:
basic, additional, extra

# Don't complicate the app too much
It's better to show more interesting language / framework features

# Tasks should have strong "visual assertions"
it should be easy to verify if task is done correctly

# Screenshots / mockups are very handful
It's much easier to explain and do a task if you have a mockup or screenshot of working functionality

#2/ Never mix refactoring and features
Either propose refactoring: "Visual assertion" - everything works the same
or new feature, but without refactoring existing code

#12/ Good Example

#2/ Basic tasks:
1. Display a single product in a shop.
2. Display many products in a shop.

#2/ Additional tasks:
1. Display discounted products (visually distinguishable).
2. Refactor single product into re-usable component.

#2/ Extra tasks:
1. Fetch products from JSON file.
2. Integrate MongoLab / Firebase and fetch products from there.
