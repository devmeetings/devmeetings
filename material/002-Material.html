            #3/ How to start?
            Look at the sprint and think of things required to implement the tasks.
            Focus on most important part to Get The Task Done - this will be what participants
            are mostly interested about.
            But it's also ok to add some tips and practical knowledge.
            ----------------
            #3/ What to avoid?
            1. Never copy-paste documentation (rather present the practical usage)
            2. Never try to explain every possible detail (focus on the essence, link to the docs)
            3. Never present solutions direct solutions to tasks - it's enough to just change the domain.
            ------------------
            #4/ Example for Modern JS for Backend Developers
            Task: Display nicely styled product.
            Slide: 
                - How to display nicely styled photo in Instagram-like app.

            Defining a tasks is obviously not enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            You also need to explain features of language / framework to participants before they start doing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tasks should be also related to presented material - participants should immediately see how to apply stuff you presented to solve the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            First give them tools and then inspire to solve the problems.
