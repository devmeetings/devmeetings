            #9/ Couple of hints when preparing slides:
            #2/ Try to keep slides minimal - don't write the code just because you can.
              - Focus on the essence of what you want to present (but it has to be still runnable)
              - Example: Avoid unnecessary styling, boilerplate code, etc.
            #1/ Comment the code - describe why you do something, the intention behind the code.
              - Comments should tell the story - imagine what you would say to your peer when explaining the code.
            #2/ Use single file (if possible) - don't jump between files, it's confusing.
              - Keep the code inside visible area - scrolling when presenting is bad.
              - Remember that you will present on low-resolution beamer.

          <p>
            There are two ways to prepare materials:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Write a second, greatly simplified App (Presentation App),</li>
            <li>Prepare examples for each required feature.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            It might be easier to prepare standalone examples (but they have to be minimal),
            but Presentation App shows natural cycle of development and also keeps consistency between slides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that the slides should also be runnable; don't present snippets - you cannot play around with them or get the full picture.
